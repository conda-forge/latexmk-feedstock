  summary: 'A perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times'
  description: |
    Latexmk is a perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times to
    resolve cross references, etc; it also runs auxiliary programs (bibtex,
    makeindex if necessary, and dvips and/or a previewer as requested).
    It has a number of other useful capabilities, for example to start
    a previewer and then run latex whenever the source files are updated,
    so that the previewer gives an up-to-date view of the document.
